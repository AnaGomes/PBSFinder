      title1: Find protein binding sites
      description1: Finding protein binding sites is easy. Just create an account, give us a list of IDs and we'll return all the relevant information for those IDs.
      title2: Mix input formats
      description2: "Supports three formats of IDs: ENSEMBL gene and transcript IDs, and ENTREZ gene IDs. The input list can be a mix of these types."
      title3: View and save your results
      description3: Results are always available through your user account, and can be exported to several formats.
      title4: Browser support
      description4: PBS Finder works with the latest versions of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Safari. Internet Explorer and Opera are also usable, but we give no official support and some features might not work as expected.

        title: Insufficient 3' UTR information
        content: The 3' UTR sequence is too short (less than 300 bp). However, due to the lack of the 3' downstream sequence, the 3' UTR sequence was analyzed.
