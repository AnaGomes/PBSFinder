    beta_title: Experimental version
    description:
      title1: Find protein binding sites
      description1: Finding protein binding sites is easy. Just create an account, give us a list of IDs and we'll return all the relevant information for those IDs.
      title2: Mix input formats
      description2: "Supports three formats of IDs: ENSEMBL gene and transcript IDs, and ENTREZ gene IDs. The input list can be a mix of these types."
      title3: View and save your results
      description3: Results are always available through your user account, and can be exported to several formats.
      title4: Browser support
      description4: PBS Finder works with the latest versions of Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. Internet Explorar and Opera are also usable, but we give no official support and some features might not work as expected.
